[See detailed API reference](/voicelab/voice-design)

After you've created your video, you have the option to monitor its progress. Once the video is fully processed, its status will update to 'completed'.

<Note>
  Alternatively, you can [configure the webhook](#configuring-webhook-optional)
  to be notified when the status of the video changes.
